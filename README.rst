Recipe for 25 liters.

Ingredients:
============

* 3 kg pale malt extract
* 18 g Tetnang bitter hops
* 15 g Hallertaver aroma hops
* 90g ground guaraná beans
* One unit Safbrew T-58 yeast
* 1.2 kg brown sugar

Procedure:
==========

Mix the malt extract, hops, sugar and guaraná with approximately 20l of water and simmer 60 min at boiling point.

After a cooling period, filter the mixture, and pour into a sealed container.

Add yeast and leave sealed in the container at room temperature for approx. 2 weeks.

Once primary fermentation is over, transfer the mixture to a clean container.

When bottling, add 4g of sugar (dissolved in water) per liter beer and a bit of yeast from the bottom of the primary fermentation container.

Leave the beer in the bottle for secondary fermentation and carbonation another 8-10 days. You will then be able to enjoy a refreshing, home brewn FREE BEER.
